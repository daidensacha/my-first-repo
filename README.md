# READ ME
## My first Gitpod/ Github repository

Welcome

In this module I was introduced to *Gitpod* and how to create and edit a *GitHub* repository in terminal. 

I was also introduced to *Git* version control, and basic commands in terminal to be able to create, edit, add, commit, 
remove and push to the remote repository. I was also taught how to create the .gitignore file to exclude files or directories 
from being tracked.

Lastly, the importance of the README file.
