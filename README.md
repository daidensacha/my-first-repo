# READ ME
## My first Gitpod/ Github repository

Welcome

-In creating this simple website I practiced HTML, HTML5, and CSS that I was introduced to in the previous modules. 
-The site displays icons and links to information on the various technologies that we will be introduced 
to and will learn in the Full Stack course.
    * HTML
    * CSS 
    * Javascript
    * Gitpod
    * Git
    * GitHub
    * Python
    * Flask
    * MongoDB
    * MySQL
    * Django
    * Heroku

- In particular, in this module I was introduced to *Gitpod*, and how to create and edit a *GitHub* repository in terminal. 

- I was also introduced to *Git* version control, and basic commands in terminal to be able to create, edit, add, commit, 
remove and push to the remote repository. I was also taught how to create the .gitignore file to exclude files or directories 
from being tracked.

-Lastly, the importance of the README file was emphasized as a source of information for the project.
